                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Statistics is the mathematical science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions under uncertainty. In the context of cybersecurity, statistics provides the foundation for detecting threats, assessing risks, and making data-driven security decisions in an environment where perfect information is never available.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>The Role of Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>Modern cybersecurity faces a fundamental challenge: distinguishing malicious activity from normal behavior in vast amounts of data. A typical enterprise network generates millions of events daily, making manual analysis impossible. Statistics provides three critical capabilities:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Statistical methods identify baseline behaviors and detect deviations that may indicate security threats.</p>
                    <p><strong>Risk Quantification:</strong> Probability theory enables organizations to measure and prioritize security risks objectively.</p>
                    <p><strong>Predictive Analysis:</strong> Historical data patterns help forecast future threats and optimize defensive strategies.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Key Statistical Applications</h2>
                
                <h3>Anomaly Detection</h3>
                <p>Anomaly detection uses statistical distributions to identify unusual patterns in network traffic, user behavior, or system logs. For example, if login attempts typically follow a normal distribution with mean μ = 50 per hour and standard deviation σ = 10, any hour with more than μ + 3σ = 80 attempts would trigger an alert for potential brute-force attacks.</p>
                
                <h3>Bayesian Threat Assessment</h3>
                <p>Bayes' theorem updates threat probabilities as new evidence emerges. When a security system detects suspicious activity, it calculates the posterior probability of an actual threat given the observed evidence, accounting for both true positive rates and false positive rates.</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a system has a 1% prior threat probability, and suspicious activity is detected that occurs in 90% of real attacks but only 5% of normal operations, Bayes' theorem calculates the updated threat probability at approximately 15.4% – a significant increase warranting investigation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Machine Learning Classification</h3>
                <p>Statistical classification algorithms power intrusion detection systems (IDS) and malware detection. Methods like logistic regression, naive Bayes, and support vector machines classify network traffic or files as benign or malicious based on statistical features extracted from training data.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Practical Example: Simple Anomaly Detection</h2>
                <p>Here's a basic implementation of statistical anomaly detection in network traffic:</p>
                
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Simulate network traffic (requests per minute)
normal_traffic = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)

# Calculate statistical thresholds
mean = np.mean(normal_traffic)
std = np.std(normal_traffic)
threshold = mean + 3 * std  # 3-sigma rule

# Detect anomalies
test_traffic = [95, 102, 98, 156, 103]  # One anomaly
anomalies = [x for x in test_traffic if x > threshold]

print(f"Mean traffic: {mean:.2f} req/min")
print(f"Threshold: {threshold:.2f} req/min")
print(f"Detected anomalies: {anomalies}")</code>
                </div>
                
                <p>This approach uses the z-score method, where values beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean are flagged as potential security incidents. The 3-sigma threshold captures 99.7% of normal behavior, making it effective for detecting outliers.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
                
                <h3>DDoS Attack Detection</h3>
                <p>Statistical time series analysis identifies Distributed Denial of Service attacks by monitoring traffic patterns. Systems establish baseline traffic distributions and use chi-square tests to detect significant deviations indicating an ongoing attack.</p>
                
                <h3>User Behavior Analytics</h3>
                <p>Organizations use statistical profiling to detect compromised accounts. By analyzing login times, access patterns, and data transfer volumes, anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual behavior such as after-hours access or geographic impossibilities (accessing from two distant locations within minutes).</p>
                
                <h3>Vulnerability Risk Scoring</h3>
                <p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) uses statistical models to quantify vulnerability severity, combining metrics like exploitability, impact, and temporal factors into a standardized risk score that guides patching priorities.</p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                
                <div class="conclusions-box">
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>Statistics is not merely useful for cybersecurity—it is fundamental. As attack volumes and sophistication increase, the ability to apply statistical reasoning to security problems becomes a critical skill. Understanding statistical concepts enables security professionals to build more effective defenses, make better risk decisions, and ultimately protect organizations more successfully.</p>
